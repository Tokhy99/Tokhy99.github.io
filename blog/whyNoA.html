<h1>Why I decided not to aim for the A in university</h1> <p>I just had one of my ordinary relapses that did lead to a minor change in my opinion regarding university's grades. I aimed, before, to get a straight A streak throughout all the university's semesters. Just to fulfill my desire of imperfect perfections. However, while I usually do not spend my whole power studying, I still spend some. I still get the slight burden of exams and grades. I am not an excellent test taker, I may be able to ace exams that rely on the live-thinking rather than preparation. So, I do not have this perk of going <strong>fully</strong> studyless and get the full grade. Taking the same point, I have a perk in exchange that I can get a <em>passing</em> grade studyless, with no background on the topic. During the debate with myself whether this was a right decision, I have asked myself some questions.</p> <p><strong>Won't your scholarship fund get fucked?</strong></p> <p>See, the scholarship requires a cumulative GPA of 3.0. N2, it is a fucking CS-related major, I am already into this stuff and I'll clear at least the first two years with straight GPA in CS-related courses without a single bit of work.</p> <p><strong>You want to be a fucking professor. How will you do so without a masters from some respected university, which you won't get in without a good GPA</strong></p> <p>Reminding you with the answer to the previous question. In addition, I found out doing 10-min research that the average GPA requires for scholarships in masters is about 3-3.5, which I still will get with the tip of my toe here.</p> <p><strong>Chill the ego bro LOL. However, what about working in some FAANG to get some money to kick your bank account?</strong></p> <p>Well, GPA for a company like Google is not required except for internship-level opportunities. While not interning for some big company will hinder my career a bit, I can make myself up for it one or two years max after graduating (That's why I'm thinking of completing in CS rather than CE). However, the GPA needed for these types of internships is still around 3.5, I may need to work a bit to stick on this average, but if I ordered my CS courses right, I will maintain the 3.5 easily. Plus, my <em>less focusing</em> on the grades will allow me to expand my scope outside the normal studying shit to learning new techniques and create new projects, which will look better in my resume than a fucking 4.0.</p> <p><strong>I am a bit convinced, but what about the connection you wanted to create with various professors so they can recommend you in their former universities (in case you wanted to master in them)?</strong></p> <p>I believe the professor will care more for my enthusiasm towards the subject than my grades. Yes, I believe grades are linked to that, but discussions with professors and practical intuition will win against some test for test-taking and wasting-time-to-revise skills.</p> <p><strong>Ok. A question for a personal preference, what sparked that idea in your mind in about 1AM?</strong></p> <p>I am having a midterm tomorrow that I am too depressed to study for.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, I see it all now, GL bro üëç.</strong></p>
