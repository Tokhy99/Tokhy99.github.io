        <h1>Perrie: An Exploration of the Gendered Predilection in Music</h1> <p style="text-align:center"><em>“Being a woman in any profession comes with a fair share of problems. Most, if not all, businesses have a stereotypical role that they believe women should fit into. And the majority of those roles revolve around positions that don’t involve any significant decision making power” Christina Estes-Wynne</em></p> <p><img src="https://scenenoise.com/Content/Articles/Big_image/9eca4462-a839-41e2-ada5-f5d281c7c12b.jpg" alt="Perrie1"></p> <p>The rap scene in Egypt has been developing extensively since 2004. However, the field is obsessively dominated by men, with no safe space for the contribution of women. Perrie, a talented modern Egyptian rapper, has faced an uncountable amount of criticism from the public throughout her career only because she is a female. In this blog post, I am highlighting Perrie’s career and highlighting the issues she encountered throughout her race, competing in a field that was considered a masculine monopoly.</p> <p><img src="https://whatwomenwant-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/perrie-el-hariri-featured-image-1170x600.jpg" alt="Perrie2"></p> <p>Perrie El Hariri is a half-Egyptian-Moroccan who graduated with a BA in Sound Engineering, Music, and Performance (Gamil). Her first published song, entitled &quot;Anaconda&quot;, has undergone massive criticism from the Egyptian rap community that focused on castigating details unrelated to the music itself. Unfortunately, music is contaminated by racial and gendered attributes rather than by judging the music itself. Griselda Pollock investigated this dilemma in <em>Vision and Difference: Femininity, Feminism, and Histories of Art</em> saying, &quot;Barr excludes as irrelevant to his story of art the nature of the society in which it arose, i.e., the character of the social structures and conflicts, the conditions of social life and exchange and thus the arena of art's production and consumption&quot; (Pollock). However, despite the hardships, Perrie has persisted in going on, ignoring the haters' opinions. Nevertheless, Perrie was fortunately strong enough to oppose the gendered opposition through her songs, posting her latest EP &quot;12:01 AM.&quot; In one of her interviews, Perrie has talked about how women are considered in the Egyptian rap scene mainly as models that market the music videos rather than being the artists themselves &quot;Women are still being used as a marketing tool either way. I want women to be themselves and be able to express what they feel&quot; (Perrie). Perrie demonstrates a model that shall be interpreted by women in Egypt that aspire to become artists in masculine-dominated fields.</p> <p><img src="https://scenenoise.com/Content/Articles/Big_image/305a93f6-8ba1-4a7a-a3b5-72c01819de4d.jpg" alt="Perrie3"></p> <p>Tameem Yonis, a famous Egyptian actor and singer, has posted an insulting song named “Salmonella,” where he talks about how he is going to harass any girl that says “No” to him. Regardless of the antipathy of the song, it got famous due to the masculine Egyptian community that appraises male violence. Perrie took a stand and decided to emphasize the fragility of Yonis’ song by replying with his way: a song that highlights his fragile masculinity. Her song “Shigella” was considered taboo in Egyptian culture. The community was used to men being brutal and women not replying. Perrie’s song influenced many female Egyptian artists to astonish in the rap scene, like Almas and Dareen. Perrie talked about the reasoning behind posting her song in an interview with Reem Gamil. “Shigella came about after watching Tameem Youness’s Salmonella. Although I am a Tameem fan, I couldn’t help but feel some frustration. In the beginning, I wasn’t too sure about it, but the more I thought about it, the more this artistic urge grew in me.” Perrie has started a movement in the Egyptian underground musical community by opening doors for more gender-diverse music with fewer industry people criticizing songs for reasons that are irrelevant to the songs themselves.</p> <h2>Works Cited</h2> <p>Estes, Christina. “A Failure of the Music Industry: The Frustration of Women of Color.” Scholarly Commons, 2019, https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=backstage-pass.
