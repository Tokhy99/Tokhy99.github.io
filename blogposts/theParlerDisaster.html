<h1>The &quot;Parler&quot; Disaster</h1> <p>While we are thriving to have a basic human right; freedom of speech, people really does not understand the concept. I am not a Trump supporter. However, what happened is magnificently total bullshit that shows the tip of monopolies' power. Google, Apple, and AWS dropped Parler instantly as it leaned towards some shitty political party. While everyone is concerned with politics, people missed the most powerful weapon raised upon us.</p> <p>Having the power of companies as big as Google gives some party of people a serious advantage over others. I am not saying any of this shit is right; there is no right here. What matters is that each person shall get the freedom of choosing his side. When monopolies decide to opt-out a specific company, almost ending their full career, do you think that is okay? This power is too much for any people to have. No governments or any fucking person on the earth shall aquire such control. Not only can they suck in any competitor easily, but they can also direct entire populations in the way THEY need, all hidden behind a wall of shitty proprietary software.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;Hey Tokhy, offer fucking solutions or shut the fuck up&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>We've always had it. The answer is in P2P networks and only OSS. But tell those sales guys who convinced the majority of people that proprietary is okay.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;Trump bad&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>This is your fucking opinion, each of us acquires a fucking brain that can think for us and decides your favourite color, food, and the fucking political party.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;What about fake news! People need to know the truth!&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Do you really think Facebook doesn't only filter the shit it opposes for instance? Do you think if AWS CEO supported trump, it would have done this shit? Do you think all news on social media currently is true, and sites only opt out the &quot;false&quot; not &quot;opposing&quot; news? If yes, then fuck off and find some contributors to your brain cause deploying a fucking working mind failed. </br></br></p> <p>We are going to face a modern dark era. The issue is exponentially developing, and we won't be able to handle it soon. I am not sure about the exact components of such an era but believe me, it will suck.</p>
