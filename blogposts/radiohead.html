<h1>Radiohead: Beautiful Mess or Sophisticated Masterpiece</h1> <p>Radiohead band is arguably the most influential and experimental rock band ever. They have transformed how people interpret rock music through close interaction with their fans. They influenced the music distribution by applying the pay-what-you-want release for their album In Rainbows.</p> <p><img src="https://thewilddetectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RadioHead.jpg" alt="moon"></p> <p>When I listened to my first Radiohead song, I was massively underwhelmed; it was just a pretty good song, but it did not meet my expectations. After I heard the song multiple times, it clicked with me the most a piece has ever clicked, making it to my top 5 songs ever easily. Videotape by Radiohead is arguably one of the most influential songs I have ever heard. The piano, the way the notes are on the half beats, so even though it’s a slow song, it still has this sense of anxiety to it or even like an impending doom almost. Also, an excellent vocal performance for Thom Yorke always brings a massive, impactful emotional impact.</p> <p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/9e/a1/ad9ea159583482e198bf9a0506a0e292.jpg" alt="video"></p> <p>Another masterpiece by Radiohead is Present Tense, a song from <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em> album that was one of the few albums that got my total 10/10 rating. The artistic nature of Radiohead has a distinct aesthetic that is not related to the beauty of the lyrics or the music alone. Still, the whole structure's distinction is what glorify's the beauty of their albums. Present Tense is a song that you can consider a bijection of the word <em>numbness</em>. It gives its listeners a unique experience with the hypnotic beat, amazing guitar, a satisfactory ending beat, and Yorke's smooth vocals.</p> <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6a/Amoonshapedpool.png" alt="pool"></p> <h2>Interviews</h2> <p>I have interviewed two friends to give them the space to reflect on the unique audible experience that comes with these songs. Here are the highlights of their experience with the songs.</p> <h3>Present Tense</h3> <p>Tarek: <em>&quot;I guess the theme of the song is “relaxing around in the middle of chaos.” It’s apparent from the tone of the singer along with the lyrics.&quot;</em></p> <p>Hourani: <em>&quot;They do have this unique vibe to them that can be seen in their music.&quot;</em></p> <p>Both Tarek and Hourani agreed on the distinctiveness and peacefulness accompanied with the music.</p> <p>Tarek: <em>&quot;Lyrics are minimal but they are structured well and definitely convey the vibe and idea of the song.&quot;</em></p> <p>Hourani: <em>&quot;I’m guessing in present tense he’s talking about losing connection? There’s something that’s being lost (a relationship maybe). The lyrics depend on what the listener has in mind&quot;</em></p> <p>Here, Tarek and Hourani has mentioned an important part of Radiohead's style; how they shape their music to suit the listeners' life without having a specified structure.</p> <p>Tarek: <em>&quot;Well, is this considered even rock? All the rock songs that I heard were very heavy with strong loud beat. This is definitely way calmer and more relaxing than any rock song that I heard.&quot;</em></p> <h3>Videotape:</h3> <p>Tarek: <em>&quot;The theme of the song is “giving up after being tired” maybe? It seems like that from the tone of the vocalist and the lyrics.&quot;</em></p> <p>Hourani: <em>&quot;Videotape gave me the impression that he’s referring to suicide or death generally. Through the song’s vibe, and lyrics of course, i think the “idea” of death can be spotted&quot;</em></p> <p>Even though people agreed with Tarek and Hourani that Videotape has suicidal vibes, Yorke announced publicly that this was not the main inspiration behind the song.</p> <p>Tarek: <em>&quot;The vocals in this song are more frequent that the one before it. The lyrics do represent the tone of the music well. They are structured well and enhance the music greatly.&quot;</em></p> <p>The experience me, Tarek, and Hourani had was similar to all Radiohead fans' experiences; distinctive aesthetics and absolute peace.</p>
