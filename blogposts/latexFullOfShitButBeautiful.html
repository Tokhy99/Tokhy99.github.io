<h1>LaTeX, full of shit but beautiful</h1> <p>While I was drinking some forgotten-till-became-cold tea, I decided to learn and use LaTeX. Why? Read my homepage.</p> <p>Since I'm still in college, I took it as an opportunity to learn it. I have never taken notes as I am positive they are pathetic as college's professors. However, since some new aspect for the thing has been formed, it is time to take &quot;notes&quot;.</p> <p>Now it's the time to learn. Oh shit, I remembered how fast I get bored off things. That's when I decided to &quot;cheat&quot; a little bit. I did the thing that I have perfected over the years; improvise. I checked #LaTeX on fosstodon to see any nerd who's using it for similar purposes. I haven't looked a lot and then found multiple people use it for the same sole purpose, so voila!</p> <p>I checked the source code for some notes, figured out the main syntax, swarmed a little for about three hours throughout people's notes. Simultaneously, I played a lot to find out my limits using it.</p> <p>I guess now I am ready to take this to the next level. Of course I will neither use some &quot;LaTeX IDE&quot; nor sacrifice my time writing this boring long repeatable syntax. Thankfully, I have been using Ultisnips for a while now aside with YouCompleteMe in vim. I wrote multiple snippets, some were inspired by <a href="castel.dev">Castel</a>. You can find the snippets <a href="https://github.com/TokieSan/dotfiles/blob/main/.vim/UltiSnips/plaintex.snippets">here</a>. Using the snippets made everything easy as fuck. I tested it the next day on some Calculus Lecture, and I found myself writing as fast or may be faster than the professor. Also, now I am a fucking nerd who takes notes. But on the other hand, my notes look aesthetically awesome. I may consider writing some textbooks in the future. You can take a look on an example for some calculus notes I wrote for the last two lectures I guess <a href="testNotesForLatexBlog.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>For the live preview, I wrote some oneliners in the .vimrc and some code that uses pdflatex to compile.</p> <p>Overall, the experience was cool, writing notes in LaTeX can make me <em>want</em> to write notes, just for aesthetic purposes. Now, the notes are done. The question is: Will I ever reopen my notes or were they written for /dev/null ?</p>
