<h1>1993-2021</h1> <p>I have never been an &quot;aggressive&quot; fan of some club/ band/ etc. I always listen to the singer then curse his ignorance. However, I could not do that to Daft Punk. We have an emotional connection. I have put Daft Punk's Random Access Memories on the top of my discography. I listened to it when I got my acceptance letter in the university. It ran automatically when I enter any new era of my life; entrance of high school, university, new house. During the final exams, I usually listen to &quot;Touch&quot; in the road.</p> <p>Homework, Discovery, and Human After All are the highest quality albums I have downloaded after RAM. I know this may be an overstatement, but when &quot;I'm lost and can't even remember my name&quot; I go for Daft Punk, and they let me know instantly what I am looking for. Listening to Daft Punk is my way of getting out of this world. Any of my friends know how much I do not care about anything. However, they also know how much I love this band.</p> <p>Nothing ever feels the same when you're not around.</p> <p>I can not believe till now how did the perfect duo that I bragged about and took an example of a perfect 'couple'. How did they break up? Daft punk was the only perfect thing in this world of imperfections. But this did not age well.</p> <p>And it was you</p> <p>The one that would be breaking my heart</p> <p>When you decided to walk away</p> <p>Me? I just wanted you to stay</p> <p>Daft Punk have given me too much to feel; the touch, I can not forget the touch. They have almost convinced me I'm real. You made me free mind about the concept of harmony in everything I do. I let go the concept of being &quot;correct&quot;. You let me to do whatever I want. You cleared any preconception of what to do. Nobody was allowed to tell me what to do, but you.</p> <p>Now, what can I consider as a truth when the only true thing in the world breaks up? I need something more. Now, the kiss won't turn me suddenly alive, and happiness will never arrive. Hunger, as a storm, will never cease. I will be stuck in a loop of rooms within rooms with no lead.</p> <p>And finally, you decided to include &quot;Touch&quot; in your epilogue. The weapon you have given me for years, was the one to kill me. &quot;Please hold on.&quot;</p> <p>All what I hear is the last thing that you said:</p> <p><img style="width:100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/sAfIPv3.png" alt="Daft Punk - Epilogue"></p>
