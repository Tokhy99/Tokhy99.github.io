        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Movies are for movie nights and emotion dealing; they're independent of your past and future, only a present to have for a specific situation. I do not watch much movies, but here is the one only movie that deserved to be put in this page. Also, to expand, I'll include my favorite director.</p>
        <hr><h2>12 Angry Men</h2>

<p>I do not remember any details of the day I watched this movie. However, I still remember each second of it. I remember each word by all of the actors. When movies go for the &quot;flexing&quot; to attract customers, this movie was only shot in a small room, with only unique ideas and moving acting. This drama went beyond the limits, it affected my life positively, maybe changed my perspective on many things. I'm usually a man who gives no shit about the rating, but this can be the only movie in the &quot;top-rated movies&quot; list that was underrated. Even the first won't be enough for this piece of art.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wes Anderson</h2>
<h2><img src="art/wesAnderson.jpg" alt="Wes Anderson"></h2>
<p>He is not here due to his gorgeous skills, he is here because he is the only director 'similar' to me. I was recommended his movie &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; by a friend. When I watched it, it was literally everything I was thinking of doing in movies. His style, music, editing, etc. interactively presents me. If you want to know more of &quot;me&quot; go watch this legend's movies.</p>

        <h2>Others</h2>
        <p>All movies I have downloaded to my Jellyfin Server are <a href="junkMovies.html">here</a>. Below me, there are some other very good movies but they didn't make it to the top. The list is not sorted.</p>
