        </h3>
        <p>
            I had to improve my grades in Calculus course, so I made a deal with the doctor to scrap all of his lectures, and write them in LaTeX format, in exchange of bonus grades. The task was fun and gave me an opportunity to learn writing in LaTeX.

            <a href="integratedessay.pdf">Honor Code |  Debate and Argument</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
            This was an assignment for an ENGL 0210 class to write an integrated essay about how useful honor code is in univirsities.
            However, I chose to critize it by emphasizing its weaknesses and listing how ineffecticve it is to "enforce academic integrity".
            The task was interesting and I performed well.

            <a href="poster.png">Abyusif Infographic | Critical Thinking</a>

        <p>
            This was one the Choice Board tasks I have chosen to do. I am already a big fan of Abyusif. Thus, I felt his personality is the most suitable one for this assignment.
