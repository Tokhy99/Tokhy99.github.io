        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Engineering and Mathematics student in a &quot;top-tier&quot; university <em>according to the provost, president, and some marketers</em>.        
                    <p>If you care about looks, use <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elt0khy">this</a> to get a glance. Feel free to go through the whole documentation.</p>

        <p>I recommend you go see my <a href="favs/">favourites</a>, It is full of cool stuff and a cool representation of me.</p>
        <p>I believe in the Arabic maxim &quot;لكل مقامِِ مقال.&quot; (every session has its own different discussion). So consider this quote a TL;DR of who am I.</p>
        <p>I guess you have known me enough. Nevertheless, let's dig in deeper.</p>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>You can think of this as Tokhy's documentation. I'd advise any future partner or a friend to read. </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>People over-estimate life most of the time. Life is simple, or at least (considering humanity's development) common sense. I used to be moved by Descartes' writings, Kant's critique, and Nietzsche's justifications. However, I came to the conclusion that this all do not precisely describe humanity. Life is just some scrambled eggs that you may favor with ketchup sauce. Some people will think you are 'disgusting'. Just tell them to mind their own eggs.</p>
        
        </br>
        <h2>Life Goal</h2>
        <p>The only goal in life is to keep living. However, I guess I want something more.</p>
        <p>I do not have a clear or specific life goal. Life will lose interest if it is always pre-thought of. The only thing that I declared as my life goal is to learn <strong>everything</strong>. However, the goal seems mathematically impossible, so I took a more straightforward approach, which is to understand everything, but not necessarily dig deep.</p>
        <p>It started in a dark night, in my conventional room, I questioned my purpose of existence. My questionnaire ended with me settling on keep lurking for life. I decided to learn every science, every specific topic in a variety of fields. Not only STEM subjects, but I would like to do music, writing, politics. In short, I want to learn everything. I do not plan to focus on long-term thinking, so I would take my time to learn whatever lies in front of me. The goal seems unreachable, but at least now I have something to do during a life-black-out or an existential-click.</p>
